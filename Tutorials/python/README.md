## 1. Introduction to Python

<p>Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and readability. This section introduces the basics of Python programming. <br>
Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.</p>
Note: The two versions of python often used are python2 and python3. In this tutorial, we use python3.

### Syntax 
Python syntax is based on a philosophy best described by the <em>Zen of Python</em> composed by <b>Tim Peters</b> <br>
- Launch your terminal, type python3 to enter interactive mode, the type this <em>import this</em> and press Enter. The output is shown below;

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly. 
Explicit is better than implicit. 
Simple is better than complex. 
Complex is better than complicated. 
Flat is better than nested. 
Sparse is better than dense. 
Readability counts. 
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity. 
Errors should never pass silently. 
Unless explicitly silenced. 
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. 
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. 
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. 
Now is better than never. 
Although never is often better than *right* now. 
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. 
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. 
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

```
<p>This Zen is also referred to as <i>PEP20</i>. There are other Python Enhancement Protocols(PEP) that provide guidelines on how to properly use python i.e recommended syntax for python and the can be found on the official python website <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/">here.</a></p>
<p>Python is an object oriented language and this makes it one of the powerful languages as it is able to mimic real world objects. To get started with object oriented programming in python, one needs to first know the basics of the language.</p>
<p>Python syntax heavily depends on <b>indentations</b>. Each indent is 4 spaces.</p>

### First python program
```python
print("Hello, Welcome to the world of python programming.")
```
